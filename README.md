## Introduction

This element generates a quote of the day. You can get inspiration form this website [BrainyQuote](https://www.brainyquote.com/).  

I decided to use my own set of quotes because of then language I use.

For me it's a nice project to sharpen my skills in; CSS3, Javascript, units tests, Polymer, Web Components and Raspberry Pi projects.  
Because this quote of the day is used in my Magic Mirror project.

## Inner workings

All quotes are bundled inside this element. You can add, change, delete the quotes in the code.
